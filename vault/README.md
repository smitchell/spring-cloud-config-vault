# SETUP

## Set-up Vault
Follow these instructions to install vault:

https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/getting-started/install

Complete the entire getting-started tutorial if you have time.

## Be Sure to update your path

Follow the Vault setup and update your path (e.g. .bash_profile).
```
export VAULT_HOME=[your path to directory containing the vault binary]
export PATH=$PATH:$VAULT_HOME
```

Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing this README file.


## Self-signed Certificates

This project is NOT running Vault with a self-signed certificate because I ran into issues connect to Vault from a Spring Boot project.
An example script to create a keystore can be found in the Spring Cloud Vault GitHub project (https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-vault) in src/test/bash/create_certificates.sh. For convenience, I included create_certificates.sh in the /vault directory of this project.
That script creates a /work directory. I renamed /work to [projects directory]/spring-cloud-config-vault/vault/certs.

# RUNNING VAULT

This section covers starting vault for the first time
(not counting if you ran it in Dev mode per https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/getting-started/dev-server).

## Start the Server using the Config File

Open a terminal, navigate to this project's /vault directory, and start Vault.

```
cd [projects directory]/spring-cloud-config-vault/vault
vault server -config ./vault-config.hcl
```

If you want try TLS run "vault server -config ./vault-config-tls.hcl"
## Initialize Vault

Open a second terminal, change to directory [projects directory]/spring-cloud-config-vault/vault, then export the environment variable shown:

### Setup without TLS
```
export VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8200
export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY=false
vault operator init
```

### Setup with TLS
```
export VAULT_ADDR=https://localhost:8200
export VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY=false
export VAULT_CAPATH=${PWD}/certs/ca/certs/ca.cert.pem
vault operator init
```

Your output will look like this *SAVE A COPY OF YOUR KEYS AND ROOT TOKEN*.
```
$ vault operator init
Unseal Key 1: FuC34l872lYb1tLKj1hGbo8kGXLO9OgKXtbd+txoI4Jm
Unseal Key 2: rKgVMScKwIUnAnKahu+OUdhNVRS92NOZmjTMgXuKDY24
Unseal Key 3: mGpGSH11uz2ED0t2A5LNRmROx8xspmiZGlJAbyrTvgxW
Unseal Key 4: EC/RnLNtvivZqMrZ29rpav6Tg/FDIIy13k6/0BM2MUPA
Unseal Key 5: JKGORcUNtqGSXbTfovin+Th9ZBpZv8R9EUPCfuyaqPOR

Initial Root Token: s.R6GdBgtUUcSrNC7teyAW0KWA

Vault initialized with 5 key shares and a key threshold of 3. Please securely
distribute the key shares printed above. When the Vault is re-sealed,
restarted, or stopped, you must supply at least 3 of these keys to unseal it
before it can start servicing requests.

Vault does not store the generated master key. Without at least 3 key to
reconstruct the master key, Vault will remain permanently sealed!

It is possible to generate new unseal keys, provided you have a quorum of
existing unseal keys shares. See "vault operator rekey" for more information.
```

## Export the Root Token

Vault commands that require authentication use the environment variable VAULT_TOKEN.
Export the token emitted to the console when you initialized Vault.
```
export VAULT_TOKEN=s.R6GdBgtUUcSrNC7teyAW0KWA
```

## Unseal Vault

Check the Vault status. It should be sealed:
```
$ vault status
Key                Value
---                -----
Seal Type          shamir
Initialized        true
Sealed             true
Total Shares       5
Threshold          3
Unseal Progress    0/3
Unseal Nonce       n/a
Version            1.2.3
HA Enabled         false
```

Use any three of the keys to unseal vault.
```
vault operator unseal rKgVMScKwIUnAnKahu+OUdhNVRS92NOZmjTMgXuKDY24
vault operator unseal EC/RnLNtvivZqMrZ29rpav6Tg/FDIIy13k6/0BM2MUPA
vault operator unseal JKGORcUNtqGSXbTfovin+Th9ZBpZv8R9EUPCfuyaqPOR
```

The output from the last unseal command should show it is now unsealed:
```
Key             Value
---             -----
Seal Type       shamir
Initialized     true
Sealed          false
Total Shares    5
Threshold       3
Version         1.2.3
Cluster Name    vault-cluster-a53bcec8
Cluster ID      cf19d6c1-24b7-e515-84eb-a7b74d622844
HA Enabled      false
```

# Create a Token to use with Spring Vault

Here we create a token with a known id simply to place it in source control for this example,
This saves you having to update the application.yml every time you reinitialize Vault.

```
$ vault token create -id="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" -policy="root"

WARNING! The following warnings were returned from Vault:

  * Supplying a custom ID for the token uses the weaker SHA1 hashing instead
  of the more secure SHA2-256 HMAC for token obfuscation. SHA1 hashed tokens
  on the wire leads to less secure lookups.

Key                  Value
---                  -----
token                00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
token_accessor       NSW9ribsBzMsoR3FrXSEUZFh
token_duration       âˆž
token_renewable      false
token_policies       ["root"]
identity_policies    []
policies             ["root"]
```

Export the new token:

```
export VAULT_TOKEN=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

## Enable the Key/Value Secrets Engine
```
vault secrets enable -path=secret kv
Success! Enabled the kv secrets engine at: secret/
```
Add some secrets
```
vault write secret/my-secret value="s3c(eT"
vault write secret/hello target=world
vault write secret/airplane type=boeing class=787
```

List the secrets
```
$ vault list secret
Keys
----
airplane
hello
my-secret
```

# DATABASE SETUP
If you don't have MySQL installed, launch it using Docker. If you already have MySQL
running create a geography database and grant user "geography_dba" all privileges to it.

```
docker \
 run \
 --detach \
 --env MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD='password1' \
 --env MYSQL_USER=geography_dba \
 --env MYSQL_PASSWORD='password2' \
 --env MYSQL_DATABASE=geography \
 --name mysql \
 --publish 3306:3306 \
 mysql
```

## Enable database secrets.
```
vault secrets enable database
```

## Add Database Configuration

Create database configuration resources using an Id with privileges to add new users.

```
vault write database/config/mysql-geography \
  plugin_name=mysql-legacy-database-plugin \
  connection_url="{{username}}:{{password}}@tcp(127.0.0.1:3306)/geography" \
  allowed_roles="*" \
  username="root" \
  password="password1"
```

## Create Database Role

Create one or more roles containing user templates to generate users. For instance, one read-only and one read-write.

```
vault write database/roles/geography-all-privileges-accounts \
    db_name=mysql-geography \
    creation_statements="CREATE USER '{{name}}'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '{{password}}';GRANT ALL ON geography.* TO '{{name}}'@'%';"
```

## Dynamically Generate User Credentials

Use the database role to dynamically generate a set of user credentials.
```
$ vault read database/creds/geography-all-privileges-accounts
Key                Value
---                -----
lease_id           database/creds/geography-all-privileges-accounts/BMpPgzfjam5YDMLBeTttSnNh
lease_duration     768h
lease_renewable    true
password           A1a-nvcb753HmF7JDPdi
username           v-geog-LoE0Cn7rI
```
